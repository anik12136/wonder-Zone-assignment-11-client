                <h2><span>1:</span> What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h2>
                <p>
                    <br />  Access Token:
                    <br /> - Purpose: Provides limited access rights to protected resources.
                    <br />   - Usage: Sent with requests to authenticate and authorize the client.
                    <br />   - Lifespan: Short-lived and expires after a certain period.
                    <br />   - Storage: Typically stored in memory or as an HTTP-only cookie for secure retrieval during API requests.
                    <br />
                    <br />   Refresh Token:
                    <br />   - Purpose: Obtains a new access token without reauthentication.
                    <br />  - Usage: Exchanged for a fresh access token when the current one expires.
                    <br />  - Lifespan: Longer-lived than access tokens.
                    <br />  - Storage: Stored securely, either as an HTTP-only cookie or in local storage, with appropriate security measures such as encryption or secure storage libraries.
                    <br />
                    <br />  Client-Side Storage:
                    <br />  - Access Tokens: Stored in memory or as an HTTP-only cookie to ensure secure API request handling.
                    <br />  - Refresh Tokens: Stored in long-term storage mechanisms like HTTP-only cookies or local storage, taking care to implement security measures to prevent theft or unauthorized access.

                    <br />  It's important to follow security best practices and consult relevant guidelines for secure handling and storage of access tokens and refresh tokens based on your specific application requirements and architecture.</p>

                <h2><span>2:</span> Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases differ in their data models, scalability approaches, data integrity, query languages, and use cases.
                    SQL databases follow a structured, tabular data model known as the relational model and use SQL as the query language. They provide strong data consistency and integrity through ACID transactions, making them suitable for applications with structured data and strict integrity requirements, such as finance and e-commerce.
                    SQL databases are vertically scalable, requiring hardware upgrades for handling increased loads beyond a certain point. On the other hand, NoSQL databases employ various data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph, offering more flexibility and schema-less data storage.
                    They prioritize scalability and performance over strict consistency and often use query mechanisms specific to their data models. NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, allowing rapid development and massive scalability, making them popular for real-time analytics, IoT, and social media platforms.

                    The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on factors like data structure, scalability needs, and application requirements.
                    SQL databases are suitable when working with structured data, complex relationships, and strict integrity needs, while NoSQL databases shine in handling unstructured data, scalability, and rapid development.
                    SQL databases offer strong data consistency through ACID transactions and a standardized query language, making them a good fit for finance, e-commerce, and data-driven enterprise applications.
                    NoSQL databases provide flexibility in data schema and prioritize scalability, making them ideal for real-time analytics, IoT, and content management systems. Both types of databases have their advantages and trade-offs, and in some cases, hybrid solutions may be employed to leverage the strengths of each, depending on specific project needs.

                    What is express js? What is Nest JS ?
                </h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <span className='bold'>Express.js :</span> Express.js is a popular, fast, and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and flexible set of features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js allows developers to create robust and scalable server-side applications by providing a lightweight, unopinionated structure that enables easy routing, middleware integration, and handling of HTTP requests and responses. It is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem due to its simplicity and extensive community support. Express.js also offers a wide range of middleware and plugins, allowing developers to extend its functionality and integrate additional features easily. With its intuitive API, Express.js empowers developers to quickly build efficient web applications using JavaScript on both the server and client sides.

                    <span>Nest JS: </span>
                    NestJS is a scalable and extensible Node.js framework that follows the Modular Monolith/Microservices architecture. Built with TypeScript, it incorporates concepts from Angular and Express.js. NestJS offers a structured approach for developing server-side applications, emphasizing decorators, dependency injection, and modules. It seamlessly integrates with other libraries and frameworks and provides built-in support for routing, middleware, authentication, and more. With its powerful CLI and testability, NestJS is widely used for developing web applications, microservices, and real-time applications, making it a popular choice in the Node.js ecosystem.

                <p><span>4: What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?
                </span><br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>    
                     MongoDB's aggregate function is a powerful tool for performing advanced data aggregation in MongoDB. It works by creating a pipeline of stages that process and transform documents. Each stage performs a specific operation, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, projecting, or joining data. The output of one stage serves as the input for the next stage, allowing for complex data manipulations. With stages like $match, $group, $project, and more, you can shape and analyze data according to your needs. The aggregate function is a valuable feature for performing intricate calculations, generating custom views, and conducting in-depth analysis on data stored in MongoDB collections.
